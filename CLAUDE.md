# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This is an early-stage project with minimal files. The repository currently contains only an empty `index.html` file, suggesting this is intended to be a web-based "MeetYourBaby" application.

## Architecture

The project structure is currently undefined. Based on the project name and the presence of `index.html`, this appears to be intended as a web application, possibly related to baby/pregnancy content.

## Development Commands

No build system, package manager, or development tools have been configured yet. When the project structure is established, common commands will likely include:

- Package management (npm/yarn/pnpm install)
- Development server
- Build process
- Testing framework

## Getting Started

Since this is a greenfield project, consider establishing:

1. **Project Type**: Determine if this will be a static site, React/Vue/Angular app, or other framework
2. **Package Manager**: Set up package.json with appropriate dependencies
3. **Build System**: Configure bundling and development tools
4. **Project Structure**: Establish directory organization for components, assets, styles, etc.

## Notes

- The project directory name suggests Korean language support may be needed
- Consider internationalization (i18n) requirements early in development
- The "MeetYourBaby" theme suggests this may be a pregnancy/parenting-related application
