- Shopping cart and checkout system
- Processing queue with progress tracking
- Order history and download management
- Mobile-responsive design

## Development Commands

**Local Development**:
```bash
# Start development server
npx http-server -p 8000 -c-1

# Access application
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

**Database Management**:
- Execute `supabase-schema.sql` in Supabase dashboard for initial setup
- Review RLS policies before production deployment

## Getting Started

Since this is a greenfield project, consider establishing:

1. **Project Type**: Determine if this will be a static site, React/Vue/Angular app, or other framework
2. **Package Manager**: Set up package.json with appropriate dependencies
3. **Build System**: Configure bundling and development tools
4. **Project Structure**: Establish directory organization for components, assets, styles, etc.

## Notes

- The project directory name suggests Korean language support may be needed
- Consider internationalization (i18n) requirements early in development
- The "MeetYourBaby" theme suggests this may be a pregnancy/parenting-related application
